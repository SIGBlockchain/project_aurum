Project Aurum
=============
Aurum is a UIC ACM proprietary blockchain project. The current planned use case is a token to be exchanged among students.

## Motivation
To create a working blockchain and learn about the technology by developing one from scratch. Developers use software engineering concepts to gather experience in constructing a complex, collaborative, and efficient product.

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- [Golang](https://golang.org/)

## Features
Aurum Phase One is a centralized blockchain that provides users with the ability to exchange tokens with each other. Future support for decentralizing Aurum will be implemented once the network grows to a sustainable level for decentralization.

## Installation
`under development`

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Run `go test -v` at project root.

## How to use?
`under development`

## Contribute
